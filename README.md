# LL-1-Parser
LL(1) Parser for a own defined programming language similar to C++. This parser goes to the very basics of formal languages, including the parsing table and the implementation of the algorithm that builds the table. 

I include the grammar I created for this language called KOD (No specific reason for that name) in a pdf. file.
There is a pdf. file because it was a college homework I did for a language and compilers course.

# How to run
This project requieres nothing more than a Java IDE installed in your computer. It uses basic Java sentences and no additional libraries were included.
I used the Eclipse IDE, but you can run it on any IDE.
